# YAClickGame (Yet Another Clicking Game)

YAClickGame is a minimal open source Android game built with Unity.

The goal is simple:
Tap the screen as many times as possible within 10 seconds.

This is an early prototype. The long-term goal is to evolve the project into a complete game with:
+ Multiple game modes (different time limits or goal to reach)
+ Sound effects and music
+ A shop system (time upgrades, cosmetics, maybe some gadgets ?)
+ More gameplay mechanics...

For now, the application is very minimal.
